# Facial Emotion Recognition
### By Team Doggomaniacs, IIT Kanpur
This repository contains all the files for Emotion Recognition through Facial Expression recognition, a summer project under Brain and Cognitive Society, IIT Kanpur.

Goal of the project:
* Design a Model for Emotion Recognition in Images.[Paper Implemented](DeXpression: Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Expression Recognition)
* Design a Model for Emotion Recognition in Videos.[Paper Implemented](Video-based emotion recognition using CNN-RNN and C3D hybrid networks)
